## NUMBER GAME
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a simple game where the computer generates a random number within a specified range, and the user tries to guess the number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.

## STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR
This program calculates and displays the total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade for a given set of subject marks. The user inputs marks obtained out of 100 for each subject, and the program sums these marks to calculate the total. The average percentage is then determined by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects. Based on the average percentage, a grade is assigned according to predefined criteria.

## ATM Machine
This project implements a simplified version of an automated teller machine (ATM) in Java consisting of two primary components â€“ `Account` and `AtmMachine`. The former manages the storage and modification of an individual's bank account balance via its methods `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `getBalance()`. Meanwhile, the latter mimics real-world ATMs by offering users a menu-driven experience encompassing actions like balance checking, cash deposits, fund withdrawals, and quitting the software. Through the `start()` function, `AtmMachine` iteratively displays the main menu until the user elects to leave by pressing '4', ensuring uninterrupted interaction throughout. While some possible improvements might involve refining validation procedures, enhancing output aesthetics, or supporting several accounts concurrently, those modifications were deliberately omitted here to emphasize fundamental ideas instead.
