## STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR
This program calculates and displays the total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade for a given set of subject marks. The user inputs marks obtained out of 100 for each subject, and the program sums these marks to calculate the total. The average percentage is then determined by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects. Based on the average percentage, a grade is assigned according to predefined criteria.
